## My process

  This challenge was a bit hard, I had to take a look at the layout template a few times before I started writing the code, and to be honest, I had to do the layout twice. The first time i couldn´t add the background colors in the correct way. Although I didn´t start from the beginning I had to take a break so I could think of the best solution and do my best on the second try.

  I completed the design of the phone without much problem, the challenge was to correctly add the background colors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I´ve practiced using relative and absolute positions, I feel more comfortable writing code.
This challenge helped me decide when it´s time to take a break, think of different solutions and put them into practice.

### Continued development

I will investigate more about how I could solve the challenge in different ways. I will definitely come back to create another solution since I´m not a hundrend percent sure of my solution but unfortunately it is the best I could think at this moment.
